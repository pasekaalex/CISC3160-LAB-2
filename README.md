# CISC3160-LAB-2
 Lab 2: used MIPS Assembly to convert decimal to binary and binary to decimal

**I chose MIPS Assembly Language through MARS4.5**
**MIPS Assembly Language seems like a good language to learn assembly with. It has general purpose registers to make coding less tedious. It also has a RISC architecture, meaning there are less instructions needed for the programmer to memorize. Classic video game consoles such as the N64 and Playstation 1/2 used MIPS processors. **
**Initially it was a very visually frustrating expreience, especially because I could only see the console after making the windows 4K fullscreen.
